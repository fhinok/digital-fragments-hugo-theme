See it live at **[adritian-demo.vercel.app](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/)** (simple demo site, vanilla installation) or **[adrianmoreno.info](https://www.adrianmoreno.info)** (my personal site, running on this theme)

This free Hugo theme is a fork of [Adritian Free Hugo Theme](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme) - a great Hugo theme created by [zetxek](https://github.com/zetexk).

It focuses on accessibility, high performance and usability. It's extendable by adding your own styles or content types, with a solid foundation.

The templates are based on Bootstrap (so they're responsive and mobile-first), and the main changes I have made have been upgrades on the web performance and accessibility of the template.

Some of the best applications for the theme are for minimalistic websites, single-page applications, and personal portfolios. It has a contact form you can customize to your mail address without setting up a backend (https://formspree.io).
